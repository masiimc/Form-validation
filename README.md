# Form-validation

ðŸ”—Live Demo : https://masiimc.github.io/Form-validation/

a form validation using regex.

To use, you must enter all the sections validly, otherwise you will be faced with a warning and the information will not be sent.

If it is valid, you will not be transferred without any part because it is a test.

And no validation has been written for the registration section.
